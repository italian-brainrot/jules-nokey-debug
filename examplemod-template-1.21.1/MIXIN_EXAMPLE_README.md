# Hello World NeoForge Mod with Mixins

This is a simple "Hello World" example of a NeoForge mod that uses Mixins to hook into Minecraft's code.

## Files Included:

### `build.gradle`
- Configured with the NeoForge Gradle plugin
- Includes proper mixin support configuration in the `neoForge {}` block
- Specifies mixin debugging options in run configurations

### `src/main/resources/examplemod.mixins.json`
- Configuration file that tells Minecraft where to find mixins
- Lists all mixin classes to be loaded
- Defines compatibility level and injection settings

### `src/main/java/com/example/examplemod/mixin/TitleScreenMixin.java`
- A simple mixin that hooks into the title screen rendering
- Prints a message to console when the title screen renders

### `src/main/java/com/example/examplemod/mixin/PlayerMixin.java`
- A mixin that hooks into the Player entity's tick method
- Prints a message every 100 ticks for each player on the server

## How to Build and Run:

1. Run `./gradlew build` to compile the mod
2. Run `./gradlew runClient` to launch Minecraft with the mod installed
3. Check console output - you should see "Hello from Mixin!" messages appear

## Key Points:

- The `mixins {}` block in build.gradle enables the mixin system
- The `.mixins.json` file defines which classes to apply mixins to
- The `@Mixin` annotation specifies which Minecraft class to patch
- The `@Inject` annotation specifies where in the method to insert code
- The `refmap` in mixins.json is automatically generated by the build system

## Troubleshooting:

- If mixins don't load, ensure the mod ID in `@Mod` annotation matches the filename of mixins.json
- If you get "Mixin didn't load" errors, check that all references match correctly
- Enable mixin debug by uncommenting the `jvmArgs "-Dmixin.debug=true"` line in build.gradle
